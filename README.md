## Description 
A basic weather dashboard that allows the user to search for a location and be presented with current weather conditions and a five-day forecast.  Previous search locations are added to the interface to allow for future searches with a single click. Duplicate entries are not saved. Supports both Fahrenheit and Celsius, with user preference saved to local storage.
